2:T40a,In the last weeks of my Computer Science II class we were given a final project to recreate a game called "Boop" as a terminal game. The project had two parts, in the first part you needed to create the game and all its logic, and in the second you had to create an AI player. After completing the game I spent a lot of time trying to tweak the AI to perform better but could never have it beat me. The project came with some starting AI code that would perform an unoptimized tree search on the game state, which was very limiting. After completing the AI I created the Boop AI Arena that removed the restrictions of the original game and allowed custom made AI to play against one another. I set up a system to measure average time, turns, and overall performance between two AI. While creating this project I experimented with Mini Max or Alpha Beta tree pruning techniques which proved as much better AI's than the original project's. I gained a lot more experience using polymorphism in c++ and organizing a medium sized project.4:["id","2","d"]
