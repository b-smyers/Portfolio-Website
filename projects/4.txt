2:T590,This project was initially inspired by my highschool physics teacher. He had tasked us to create a trebuchet to launch a golfball as far as possible. We were provided with 2x4's, wood screws, a few power tools, and a drill press to create large holes (with supervision of course). Very early into the design phase of the project, the class stumbled into a website that could model the characteristics for any given trebuchet design. The website can tell me how good a design is, but It couldn't tell me the BEST trebucet design. So I decided to create a program in python to programatically optimize trebuchet designs by tweaking parameters and recording the results of the best designs. I got experience using Selenium to immitate user inputs, numpy for working with the data, and pandas to sort and export data to a spreadsheet. After running for a while the design my group settled on stood about 7 feet tall and achieved a max projectile distance of 165ft! When we eventually built and tested the trebuchet we achieved ~150ft of distance, only a 9% difference from the expected result. The trebuchet website also has a user projects page where users can compare the theoretical and actual distances, and our design was within the typical ~20% accuracy window. While programmatically simple, this was then one of my favorite projects because I was able to integrate my computer knowledge into real life design challenges.4:["id","4","d"]
