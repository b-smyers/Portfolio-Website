2:T58b,During my sophomore year of high school, the concept of a procedurally generated dungeon crawler game finally materialized into a project outline on paper. Despite the initial detailed requirements, Dungeon Odyssey's inception wasn't straightforward. On June 17, 2020, I made my initial attempt to bring the game to life as a turn-based dungeon crawler. However, the gameplay felt static, and the dungeon room generation was overly limited, lacking space for future creativity. After completing the initial prototype, it was evident that the game's requirements needed revising, and the project's scope needed to be reduced. Many non-essential or flawed features were scrapped, replaced by core ideas that seamlessly integrated with the existing requirements. Work on the current version of the game commenced on November 14, 2020. Adopting a broader perspective, I devised a set of custom services to simplify common functions into reusable components. These services managed items, inventories, experience, entities, and item models, among others. These adjustments led to significant progress, shaping the game into its current form. While Dungeon Odyssey might not achieve widespread popularity, it provided invaluable experience in navigating a complex and interconnected code base. Moreover, it served as a platform to hone my cybersecurity skills through cheat prevention techniques and client/server seperation.4:["id","0","d"]
