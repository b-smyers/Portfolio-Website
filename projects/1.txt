2:T58f,I first encountered Battlecode during a software tools class, where we organized into groups for our semester project. This year's challenge was a capture-the-flag-style game, where the objective for the AI was to capture three enemy flags for victory. As I delved deeper into the Battlecode API, I found myself captivated by the project, prompting me to swiftly begin crafting my initial prototype. Much of the strategy for our first prototype was guided by intuitive principles such as "If you're low on health, then retreat." Our group met weekly to discuss our progress and set goals for the following week. Additionally, we presented bi-weekly progress reports to the class, a task I particularly enjoyed due to my passion for the project. Towards the end of the semester, I experimented with a GitHub workflow to conduct scrimmages pitting our best AI against some of the open-source competitors from that year. Impressively, our AI dominated the high school bracket, remaining undefeated throughout. However, this success didn't translate to the international bracket, where we experienced some setbacks. Despite this, our performance allowed us to estimate our AI's position around 16th place. As first-time competitors, our efforts yielded a formiddable AI. Furthermore, the project provided invaluable experience with JUnit, Gradle, and GitHub Actions. I eagerly look forward to participating in Battlecode again.4:["id","1","d"]
